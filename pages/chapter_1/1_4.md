### Prompt

Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

### Solution

Using applicative-order evaluation, we can apply _a-plus-abs-b_ to the arguments _2_ and _4_:

```
(a-plus-abs-b 2 4)

((if (> 4 0) + -) 2 4) ;; substitute the arguments for the formal-parameters in the procedure body

(+ 2 4) ;; since the operands are primitive, we don't need to evaluate them, we can just evaluate the compound expression to get our operator

(6) ;; apply our operator to our operands
```
