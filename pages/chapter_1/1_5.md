### Prompt

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

```
(define (p) (p))
```

```
(define (test x y)
    (if (= x 0)
        0
        y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form _if_ is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)

### Solution

An interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation will evaluate the arguments, then apply the operator to them. To illustrate:

```
(test 0 (p)) ;; the first argument (0) is primitive, the second argument is an expression that we need to evaluate
(test 0 (p)) ;; when we evaluate (p), we get (p)
(test 0 (p)) ;; this will 'recurse' forever, never evaluating to a primitive that we can use
...
...
..

```

An interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation will not evaluate the arguments until they are needed. To illustrate:

```
(test 0 (p))
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p)) ;; replace the formal parameters with the arguments in the procedure body
(0) ;; evaluate the predicate, returning the consequent
0 ;; the result
```
