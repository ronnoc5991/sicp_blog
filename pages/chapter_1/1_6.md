### Prompt

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form. "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond`?" she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of `if`:

```
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
    (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

`(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)`

_5_

`(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)`

_0_

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square-root program:

```
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
    (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
        x)))
```

What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

### Solution

When Alyssa invokes her version of `sqrt-iter`, she will see that it recurses to no end.

To illustrate:

```
(sqrt-iter 1 4) ;; initial invocation
(new-if (good-enough? 1 4) 1 (sqrt-iter (improve 1 4) 4)) ;; substituting the arguments for parameters in procedure body
```

At this point in the evaluation, the interpreter (using applicative order evaluation) will evaluate the arguments to `new-if` before applying the `new-if` procedure. This means that `sqrt-iter` will get invoked again since it is the `else-clause` argument to `new-if`. This pattern will continue without end.

Since the ordinary `if` is a special form, the interpreter evaluates neither the _then-clause_ nor the _else-clause_ until it has first evaluated the predicate. Only then can it determine which clause to evaluate (leaving the other clause unevaluated).
