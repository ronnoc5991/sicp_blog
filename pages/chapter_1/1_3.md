### Prompt

Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

### Solution

```
(define (sum-of-squares a b)
  (+ (* a a) (* b b)))
```

```
(define (my-procedure a b c)
  (cond ((and (< a b) (< a c)) (sum-of-squares b c))
         ((and (< b a) (< b c)) (sum-of-squares a c))
         (else (sum-of-squares a b))))
```
