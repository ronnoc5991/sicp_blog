### Prompt

Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor _make-segment_ and selectors _start-segment_ and _end-segment_ that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the _x_ coordinate and the _y_ coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor _make-point_ and selectors _x-point_ and _y-point_ that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure _midpoint-segment_ that takes a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).

### Segment constructor and selectors

```
(define (make-segment start end)
    (const start end))
```

```
(define (start-segment)
    (car segment))
```

```
(define (end-segment)
    (cdr segment))
```

### Point constructor and selectors

```
(define (make-point x y) (cons x y))
```

```
(define (x-point point) (car point))
```

```
(define (y-point point) (cdr point))
```

### Midpoint

```
(define (midpoint-segment segment)
    (make-point
        (/
            (+
                (x-point
                    (start-segment segment))
                (x-point
                    (end-segment segment)))
            2)
        (/
            (+
                (y-point
                    (start-segment segment))
                (y-point
                    (end-segment segment)))
            2)))
```
